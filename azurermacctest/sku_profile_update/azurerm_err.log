Test Case: sku_profile_update
================================================================================

Step 2 Failed: AzureRM Baseline Test - terraform init

Failed Command: terraform init

Error:
╷
│ Error: Terraform encountered problems during initialisation, including problems
│ with the configuration, described below.
│
│ The Terraform configuration must be valid before initialization so that
│ Terraform can determine which modules and providers need to be installed.

╷
│ Error: Argument or block definition required

│   on main.tf line 29:
│   29: }
│
│ An argument or block definition is required here.
╵

Root Cause Analysis:
There is a syntax error in main.tf - an extra closing brace on line 29 (after the provider "azurerm" block).
According to test guidelines, main.tf is [Trusted, DO NOT MODIFY], which means this test case setup is invalid.

Conclusion:
Test case marked as 'invalid' because main.tf contains a syntax error that prevents terraform initialization.
This is a setup issue, not a module conversion problem.
