Test Case: extension_protected_settings_from_key_vault_updated
================================================================================

Step 2 Failed: Baseline Test

Failed Command:
terraform init

Error Message:
╷
│ Error: Terraform encountered problems during initialisation, including problems
│ with the configuration, described below.
│
│ The Terraform configuration must be valid before initialization so that
│ Terraform can determine which modules and providers need to be installed.

╷
│ Error: Argument or block definition required

│   on main.tf line 29:
│   29: }
│
│ An argument or block definition is required here.
╵

Root Cause Analysis:
The main.tf file contains a syntax error - an extra closing brace "}" on line 29.
The provider "azurerm" block (lines 18-28) has correct syntax with a closing brace at line 28,
but line 29 has an additional stray closing brace that doesn't match any opening brace.

This is a configuration error in the trusted main.tf file that cannot be modified per test guidelines.
The test case is marked as invalid because the baseline AzureRM configuration cannot initialize.

Conclusion:
Test case marked as invalid due to syntax error in trusted main.tf file that prevents initialization.
This is not a module implementation issue but a test case configuration issue.
