Test Case: priority_mix_policy

Step 2 Failed: Terraform Init

Failed Command:
terraform init

Error Message:
╷
│ Error: Terraform encountered problems during initialisation, including problems
│ with the configuration, described below.
│
│ The Terraform configuration must be valid before initialization so that
│ Terraform can determine which modules and providers need to be installed.

╵
╷
│ Error: Argument or block definition required
│
│   on main.tf line 29:
│   29: }
│
│ An argument or block definition is required here.
╵

Root Cause Analysis:
The main.tf file contains a syntax error on line 29 - an extra closing brace that doesn't match any opening block. The provider "azurerm" block has two closing braces:
- Line 27: closes the features block
- Line 28: closes the provider block
- Line 29: extra closing brace with no matching opening brace

Since main.tf is marked as [Trusted, DO NOT MODIFY] in the test guide, and this syntax error prevents Terraform initialization, this test case must be marked as invalid.

The file appears to have been corrupted or incorrectly generated. The correct structure should have the provider block closing at line 28 without the extra closing brace on line 29.

Conclusion:
Test case marked as invalid due to syntax error in trusted infrastructure file (main.tf) that cannot be modified per test guidelines.
