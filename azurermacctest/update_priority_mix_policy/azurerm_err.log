Test Case: update_priority_mix_policy

Step 2 - Baseline Validation Failed

Failed Command: terraform init

Error:
Terraform encountered problems during initialisation, including problems
with the configuration, described below.

The Terraform configuration must be valid before initialization so that
Terraform can determine which modules and providers need to be installed.

Error: Argument or block definition required
  on main.tf line 29:
  29: }

An argument or block definition is required here.

Root Cause Analysis:
The main.tf file contains a syntax error - there is an extra closing brace on line 29.
The provider "azurerm" block structure:
- Line 18: provider "azurerm" {
- Lines 19-27: features { ... }
- Line 28: } (closes features block)
- Line 29: } (EXTRA BRACE - should not exist, closes provider block prematurely)

This extra closing brace causes Terraform to expect more content after line 28 but finds
an unexpected closing brace on line 29.

According to test guidelines, main.tf is marked as "Trusted, DO NOT MODIFY", however
this file has a fundamental syntax error that prevents any terraform command from
executing successfully.

Conclusion:
Test case marked as INVALID due to corrupted main.tf file with syntax error.
The file requires manual correction before testing can proceed.
