Test Case: disks_data_disk_storage_account_type_premium_v2_lrs
================================================================================

Initial Error:
Error: Unsupported attribute

  on azapi.tf line 102, in resource "azapi_update_resource" "update0":
 102:     ignore_changes = [all]

This object has no argument, nested block, or exported attribute named "all".

Fix Process:

Attempt 1:
- Problem Analysis: The lifecycle ignore_changes block uses [all] which requires Terraform 1.8+ but the syntax is incorrect. The correct syntax is just "all" without brackets.
- Fix Method: Change ignore_changes = [all] to ignore_changes = all
- Changes Made: Modified azapi.tf line 102
- Result: Success - terraform plan now runs successfully and shows acceptable drifts (API version change, computed fields, azapi_update_resource creation)

Final Result: Fix successful
